<h2><span>Zhongguo Souvenir was founded in October, 2017, by a certain S. Xu, somewhere up in the Hudson Valley. We as a brand opts for a more obscure <i>pinyin</i> "Zhongguo," instead of "China," in order to "invoke and recall a place, unreachable, a place as a souvenir, a souvenir for self-identified exiles like me..." (as Xu told a local literary gazette, Jan 2018). We specialize in tourist souvenir-inspired T-Shirts, each uniquely designed print representing a destination in China. <br><br>
Eight designs ("Great Wall" design temporarily out of stock) are available for purchase, please see <a href="#shop"> #SHOP</a> section for details. You can read more about the stories behind the T-shirts in <a href="#shop">#STORIES</a>, find additional visuals in <a href="#acrossthewall"> #AcrossTheWall</a>, learn about souvenir cares in <a href="#care"> #CARE</a>. <br><br>
If you have any questions, or would like to submit a design(yes - we accept submissions!), please find our contact info in <a href="#contact">#CONTACT</a>.
